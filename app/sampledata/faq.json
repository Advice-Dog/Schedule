            "question": "How will DEF CON maintain social distancing?",
            "answer": "Social distancing measures may include distanced seating in event rooms, traffic lanes in the hallways, larger rooms, more strategic areas for food and drinks, dedicated entry and exit points, and more. There will be dedicated support onsite to ensure our rules are being followed.One of the big visible changes is that we have removed all in-person speaking tracks. Because we don't know how many people are planning to attend we couldn't design the floor plan. By releasing the talks online allows us to complete the floor plan and have attendees focus more on village and events."

            "answer": "Chill out lounges and other food service may look a little different than previous years in order to adhere to safety measures, but we intend to provide for purchase take away options in a pre-packaged format. No buffet sneezes to worry about."
